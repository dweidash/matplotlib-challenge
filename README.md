# matplotlib-challenge

There are numerous interesting insights from this challenge. I will be presenting three while envisioning myself having to provide a 'top three' observations for the data set as if presenting it to the lead research committee.

The most obvious observation is that Capomulin is the only successful drug that passed all tests among the four that were noted to be of analytic interest. It exceeded phenomenonly as it sported the smallest growth of metastatic spread, and had the highest survival rate amongst all four. As seen in the 'Tumor Responses' graph, the responses by the tumors reduced over time.

The other three drugs proved to be ineffective in varying degrees. Infubinol seemed to have some effect while the others were not as effective. When addressing the three, it will be useful to notate that Infubinol, Placebo, and finally Ketapril are in order in terms of positive effectives to least effective amongst the failed drugs. This insight may be useful to note to the teams dedicated to the development of each drug so they may decide if their previous version of the drug had worse or better effects. This insight will help them assess whether their most recent changes impacted their drug effects.
